# Material Symbols for Jetpack Compose

ImageVector version of the Material Symbols icons. This library is created by converting xml icons from 
[the material-design-icons repo](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/tree/master/symbols/android)
using a modified version the 
[AndroidX material icons generator](https://github.com/androidx/androidx/tree/androidx-main/compose/material/material/icons/)
Gradle module. Only for AndroidX Compose, it's not ~~(yet)~~ compatible with JetBrains Compose Multiplatform.

# Usage

This library is ~~for now~~ only available in GitHub Packages. 

For Gradle Dsl:

```kotlin
// in settings.gradle.kts
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositories {
        maven {
            url = uri("https://maven.pkg.github.com/tclement0922/material-symbols-compose")
            credentials {
                // replace with your username
                username = "YOUR_USERNAME"
                // replace with a personal access token (classic) that has at least the :read_packages scope and linked to the username above
                password = "YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN"
            }
        }
    }
}

// in your project module build.gradle.kts
dependencies {
    implementation("dev.tclement.compose.symbols:core:1.0.0")

    // the variant you want to use
    // replace THEME with one of these: outlined, rounded, sharp
    // replace GRADE with one of these: g0, g200, gn25
    // replace WEIGHT with one of these: w100, w200, w300, w400, w500, 600, w700
    implementation("dev.tclement.compose.symbols:THEME-GRADE-WEIGHT:1.0.0")
}
```

# How to build

1. [Download](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/archive/master.zip) and extract the 
    source repo in `symbols/source-icons`. 

    For example on Linux:
    ```shell
    wget -O symbols/source-icons.zip https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/archive/master.zip
    unzip symbols/source-icons.zip "material-design-icons-master/symbols/android/*" -d "symbols/source-icons/"
    ```
2. Run the Gradle task `:symbols:generateSymbolsFiles`.
3. Run the Gradle task `:symbols:assembleRelease` (this might take a while, change the
   `org.gradle.workers.max` property and the Gradle heap size from `gradle.properties` if you have
   enough memory).
4. The AARs will be in the `build/outputs/aar` directory.
